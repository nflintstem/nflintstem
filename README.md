## Hello 👋 I'm Nate, nice to meet you :) 

<!--
**nflintstem/nflintstem** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

### Let's Talk More
I'm Nate and I am a graduate based in Lincoln, UK. You'll mostly catch me in Lincoln, however failing that you will usually find me in my hometown of Cambridge, UK, and am open to making Cantabrigian connections too. My areas of expertise/interest are Probability and Statistics and Data Analysis. I've applied techniques ranging from PCA to artificial neural networks to analyse and observe patterns in data and statistics. I am interested in doing things such as this for a career and am doing a masters degree in Data Science.

Currently I am working on getting everything from my undergraduate from assignments and general uni work onto a repository as a means of storage. I have removed a few repos due to them being unused with little faith in them ever being used. There will probably be things put here Summer 2023, such as an expansion of the card game program from first year to a new game I've learnt throughout my time at university that I thoroughly enjoy and has helped me mentally through some tough times. A repo should now exist for Postgraduate work

I have experience in Python, MATLAB, C#, and C++. I have also used Pascal and Haskell in the past, I cannot guarantee I'll be able to put that here as I have not used those in many years. I also have added OpenCL experience with C++, but out of the four languages I have used, Python is the language I have the most experience with in a data analysis context. I have tried looking into Java, and may do more on this in the future, but this would be more for hobby purposes and not for anything career related.

The best way of reaching me is LinkedIn. I will also attach my bio
