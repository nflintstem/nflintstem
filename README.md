## Hello 👋 I'm Nate, nice to meet you :) 

<!--
**nflintstem/nflintstem** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

### Quick Facts
👨Nate, he/they <br />
📍Lincoln, UK (occasionally Cambridge, UK) <br />
🎓Maths and Compsci -> Data Science <br />
🧠Data Analysis, Probability and Statistics <br />
🖥️Python, MATLAB, C#, C++. Potentially some Pascal and Haskell. <br />

### Let's Talk More
I'm Nate and I currently study at uni in Lincoln, UK. You'll mostly catch me in Lincoln as I intend to be here into the medium/longer term, but you'll also find me in my hometown of Cambridge, UK, and am open to making Cantabrigian connections too. My areas of expertise/interest are Probability and Statistics and Data Analysis. I've applied techniques ranging from PCA to artificial neural networks to analyse and observe patterns in data and statistics. I am interested in doing things such as this for a career and aim to do a masters in Data Science.

Currently I am working on getting everything from my projects from assignments and general uni work onto a repository as a means of storage. I have a few private repos, largely projects I started or allocated myself to start but never finished, and some of these are years old. Maybe I'll get there eventually. There will probably be things put here Summer 2023, such as an expansion of the card game program to a new game I've learnt throughout my time at university that I thoroughly enjoy and has helped me mentally through some tough times. I may also potentially be doing an internship too. All good things.

I have experience in Python, MATLAB, C#, and C++. I have also used Pascal and Haskell in the past, I cannot guarantee I'll be able to put that here as I have not used those in many years. I also have added OpenCL experience with C++, but out of the four languages C++ is the one I prefer least. C# and MATLAB especially are where I excel. I have tried looking into Java, and may do more on this in the future, but this would be more for hobby purposes and not for anything career related.

The best way of reaching me at the moment is LinkedIn for anything work related. If you just want a general chat I may link my instagram in the bio, however I am not too keen on advertising that sort of thing on a platform I mainly use for productivity, so please try LinkedIn first.
